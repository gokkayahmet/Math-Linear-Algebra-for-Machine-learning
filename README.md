# Math-Linear-Algebra-for-Machine-learning
Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with the theory and application of linear equations, linear transformations, vector spaces, and matrices. It is a fundamental tool in many fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and computer science. 



$$\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \
3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}$$


This creates a matrix that looks like:

$$|1 2|
|3 4|$$

You can also use other matrix environments, such as pmatrix, vmatrix, and bmatrix, depending on the style you prefer. Here's an example of a 3x3 matrix using the pmatrix environment:

$$\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \
4 & 5 & 6 \
7 & 8 & 9
\end{pmatrix}$$


This creates a matrix that looks like:

$$|1 2 3|
|4 5 6|
|7 8 9|$$
